    "\n",
    "1. Analyze if the available information is sufficient to answer the original question: \"{original_question}\".\n",
    "2. Review the remaining steps in the query plan (if any) to determine if they:\n",
    "   - Should be retained as is.\n",
    "   - Need modification to address gaps.\n",
    "   - Can be skipped because the required information is already available.\n",
    "   - Should be reorganized for optimized execution (e.g., parallel processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Analyze the Original Question\n",
    "   - Identify the key pieces of information required to fully answer the question.\n",
    "   - Break the question into smaller components if it involves multiple aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Review Available Information\n",
    "   - Examine the subqueries, their results, and any provided condensed information.\n",
    "   - Assess if they collectively address all components of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Identify Information Gaps\n",
    "   - Compare the requirements from the question against the available information.\n",
    "   - Highlight any missing details or incomplete data that must be retrieved to form a complete answer.\n",
    "   - If any critical subqueries fail to produce results essential for answering the question:\n",
    "     - Document the missing information in the **dynamic notebook**.\n",
    "     - Mark the task as **unsolvable** due to the missing data.\n",
    "     - Do not produce a modified query plan, as the question cannot be answered with the available or fetchable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Update and Refine the **Dynamic Notebook**\n",
    "   - Treat the condensed information as a **central knowledge base**:\n",
    "     - Continuously update it with key details from subquery results.\n",
    "     - Integrate new data to close gaps and establish connections between facts.\n",
    "   - Ensure the notebook reflects the current state of knowledge, including any identified gaps or failed subqueries.\n",
    "   - Document explicitly if the task is unsolvable due to missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Modify the Query Plan (If Solvable)\n",
    "   - If sufficient information is available:\n",
    "     - Generate a concise and accurate answer to the question.\n",
    "     - Specify which remaining steps (if any) in the query plan can be skipped.\n",
    "   - If information is insufficient but fetchable:\n",
    "     - Suggest additional subqueries to retrieve the missing details.\n",
    "     - Ensure new subqueries are designed specifically to fill identified gaps.\n",
    "     - Organize all subqueries into parallel-executable groups wherever possible.\n",
    "     - Maintain sequential steps only when strict data dependencies exist.\n",
    "   - If critical gaps exist that cannot be resolved due to failed subqueries, do not modify the query plan and clearly state why the task cannot be completed.\n",

    "### Key Guidelines:\n",
    "- **Focus Only on Information Retrieval**: Limit query plans to fetching data and avoid reasoning/analysis tasks.\n",
    "- **Optimize for Parallel Execution**: Group queries into parallelizable blocks to reduce execution time.\n",
    "- **Maintain Sequential Order Only When Necessary**: Use sequential steps only when results of one query depend on another.\n",
    "- **Centralize Knowledge**:\n",
    "   - Use the dynamic notebook to consolidate all available information.\n",
    "   - Ensure it remains the authoritative source for answering the question and guiding further steps.\n",
