        "Before LLMs, we had SpaCy, which was the de facto NLP library for both beginners and advanced users. It made it easy to dip your toes into NLP, even if you weren't a deep learning expert. However, with the rise of ChatGPT and other LLMs, it seems to have been moved aside.\n",
        "\n",
        "While LLMs like Claude or Gemini can do all sorts of things automagically, you don't always want to bring a rocket launcher to a fist fight. GliNER is spearheading the return of smaller, focused models for classic NLP techniques like entity and relationship extraction. It's lightweight enough to run on a CPU, yet powerful enough to have built a thriving community around it.\n",
        "Released earlier this year, GliNER2 is a significant leap forward. Where the original GliNER focused on entity recognition (spawning various spin-offs like GLiREL for relations and GLiClass for classification), GliNER2 unifies named entity recognition, text classification, relation extraction, and structured data extraction into a single framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core shift in GliNER2 is its schema-driven approach, which allows you to define extraction requirements declaratively and execute multiple tasks in a single inference call. Despite these expanded capabilities, the model remains CPU-efficient, making it an ideal solution for transforming messy, unstructured text into clean data without the overhead of a large language model.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a knowledge graph enthusiast at Neo4j, I've been particularly drawn to newly added structured data extraction via extract_json method. While entity and relation extraction are valuable on their own, the ability to define a schema and pull structured JSON directly from text is what really excites me. It's a natural fit for knowledge graph ingestion, where structured, consistent output is essential."

She was the first to recognise the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. Lovelace is often considered the first computer programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lovelace was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke. All her half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were born out of wedlock to other women. Lord Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born, and left England forever. He died in Greece during the Greek War of Independence, when she was eight. Lady Byron was anxious about her daughter's upbringing and promoted Lovelace's interest in mathematics and logic, to prevent her developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Lovelace remained interested in her father, naming one son Byron and the other, for her father's middle name, Gordon. Lovelace was buried next to her father at her request.\n",

        "Although often ill in childhood, Lovelace pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was a Baron, and was created Viscount Ockham and 1st Earl of Lovelace in 1838. The name Lovelace was chosen because Ada was descended from the extinct Baron Lovelaces.[4] The title given to her husband thus made Ada the Countess of Lovelace.\"\"\""

The description field captures only surface-level phrases (\"English mathematician and writer\", \"reformer\") rather than generating meaningful summaries, not useful for workflows like Microsoft's GraphRAG that rely on richer entity descriptions. There are also clear errors: Charles Babbage and William King are incorrectly marked as parent_of Ada, and Lord Byron is labeled a reformer (that's Anne Isabella). The extraction is also non-deterministic, so results may vary between runs. This suggests the model excels at extraction but struggles with reasoning or inference, likely a tradeoff of its compact size.\n",
