    "\n",
    "Up until this point, all the above graph analysis could be done with the native projection. Cypher projection can project graphs that exist only at query time or when we want to use more advanced filtering than just node labels or relationship types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical PageRank is a concept first introduced by Kenny Bastani in his blog post. I have also written a blog post about it using the Graph algorithms library. Now it is time to demonstrate it with the Graph Data Science library as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind it is pretty simple. As shown in the example above we have a graph of pages that have links between each other and might also belong to one or more categories. To better understand the global pagerank score of nodes in a network, we can breakdown our graph into several subgraphs, one for each category and execute the pagerank algorithm on each of that subgraphs. We store results as a relationship property between category and pages. This way we can break down which are the contributing categories to page’s global pagerank score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by assuming that each interaction is a positive endorsement(I know it's actually not, but let's pretend). We will breakdown our graph into several subgraphs by the class(men, elves), that the characters belong to. For example, when calculating pagerank for the category of men, all nodes will be considered, but only relationships that come from characters that belong to the class of men will be considered."
