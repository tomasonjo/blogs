    "A couple of days ago, I stumbled upon the network visualizations of travel logs made by Pieter Levels on his NomadList website. NomadList is a website that builds the infrastructure to help digital nomads live anywhere in the world and connect with like-minded people. So I asked Pieter on Twitter if he could share the underlying data for travel logs, and lo and behold, the very next day, he made the aggregated travel logs data publicly available. The only fitting next step for me was to take that data and plug it into Neo4j and play around with it. This blog post will present some of my findings and also show you how to use the new Link Prediction Pipeline to predict new connections in a graph.\n",

    "The graph model consists of cities, which are represented as nodes, and travel logs described as relationships.The travel logs are already aggregated in the underlying data, so we only know how many travels were made from one city to another. Unfortunately, there is no time component in the data, so we can't compare pre and post-pandemic travels or how long a person stayed in that city. All we know is that all travels happened somewhere between 2014 and 2021, and the data is available for top 50 cities per continent. On a more technical level, we are dealing with a directed weighted graph.\n",

We lack that information, so we can only hypothesize. All in all, seems that Thailand and Western Europe are popular destinations for digital nomads. For good measure, also Singapore, New York and San Francisco are included.\n",

As a European, I imagine that trips up to 1000km are one night-train away, and as far I have heard for Americans, that's almost like a commute to work. Even a 2000km trip is, on average, only a two-hour flight. For the rest 30% of travels, I imagine they are most likely cross-continental trips. My hypothesis is that digital nomads like to travel across continents, and then explore that continent by moving from city to city. Of course, this is only my hypothesis, and I could be wrong.\n",

    "One important disclaimer is that, in this example, the betweenness centrality doesn't take the relationship weights into account. If you were to take a trip around the world and follow the typical digital nomad travel patterns, you would likely end up at these cities at some point in time. For example, if you travel between Europe and Asia, you have good chances of ending up in Dubai sooner or later. I already mentioned before that I would be interested in learning if nomads stay longer in London or visit it only to fly out across continents. Similarly, you could interpret these results as having New York and Mexico be entry or exit points to North America.\n",

In our example with the NomadList travel logs, the most popular nomad destinations should have the highest score.

It is used to predict new connections in the network that do not exists yet. You can think of it as a binary classification model that indicates if a new link is likely to exist between pairs of nodes. There are several applications for link prediction ranging from recommender systems to drug repurposing. To start, you first have to define a new link prediction pipeline."

You can also fine-tune algorithm hyper-parameters in the configuration of this step. Next, we need to define how to combine a link's source and target node features to produce an input to the link prediction model. Remember, the link prediction model in Neo4j GDS is a binary classification model that uses logistic regression under the hood. The output is either a 1 or 0 if a connection exists in the network or not, and the input features are combined by considering both source and target node features. At the moment, the pipeline features three different ways of combining node features:\n",

The only prediction that seems a bit off is connecting Conakry in Guinea to Abbotsford in Canada."
